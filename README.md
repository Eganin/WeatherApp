# WeatherApp

## :scroll: Description
This application presents dynamic weather, conveying the weather through a landscape whose details change depending on the time, weather and location at that particular moment.
This dynamic landscape repeats the day/night cycle with several layers that change depending on the phase of the day (night, sunrise, day and sunset). 
In addition, a particle generation system has been created to draw clouds and rain.
The app also displays basic weather information in four sections:
- Details: current weather.
- A graph showing the temperature as a function of time. 
- Weather Radar
- For this week : 7 day forecast
